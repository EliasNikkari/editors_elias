      <p>The Playstation 4 was released in the year 2013, and the Playstation 5 was released in 2020. To me it feels like the Playstation 5 was just released not long ago, but somehow it has almost been 3 years already. I have played on the Playstation 2 and owned a Playstation 3, and I really liked the Playstation 4. Personally i did not really get as much use out of it as of the Playstation 3, but i suppose that is because i had moved almost completely to PC gaming at that point.</p>

<div class="text">
      <p>This is no unpopular opinion: The Playstation 4 had really good games. With exclusive games such as: Gran turismo sport/7, Uncharted series, God of war, The Last of Us 1 remastered, The Last of Us 2 and Bloodborne, there were so many exclusive games to sink your time into. I only recently played through The Last of Us series and words cannot explain how good the game is. The writing, the characters and the world feel so real and there is so much emotion. The fights are very tense, because of the limited amount of ammunition you have at all times, so you really have to strategize every fight before starting your ambush. I would call The Last of Us games masterpieces.</p>
      <p>The Playstation 5 has never really interested me except for the initial hype building up before the release. The price of the Playstation 5 got me uninterested in it really quickly though. In my opinion it is quite a dirty business trick to sell the same console, but without a CD-drive for just a 100 euros less. The 100 euro difference is enough to get many people to forget the CD-drive and to get them into the monopoly of being able to buy games only through the official Playstation store. See a good deal on a game from your wishlist in your local videogame store? Too bad, that you opted to cheap out of the CD-drive.</p>
      <p>I feel like The Playstation 5 has quite a small amount of games that could potentially interest me enough to buy the console. I would get it only for playing Gran Turismo 7 with better graphics and performance. Other than that i don't really have any reason to buy the console, because most of the games on it, are also playable on PC. It just feels like there is no games on the console. Funnily enough that has been a big meme on the internet: "Playstation 5 has no games". A lot of people who are not buying the console as their only console just to play some games once in a while casually, are frustrated with it. A lot of the games are playable on the previous Playstation 4, and almost every game is playable on PC with a keyboard and a mouse.</p>
