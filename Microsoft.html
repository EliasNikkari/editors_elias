		  <p>I had an Xbox 360 as a kid and still have it. Great console with great games. But i can't really say much about Xbox One and the newer Xbox consoles from my own experience. When Xbox One released, i actually kinda wanted one just because of the exclusive Forza Horizon games. Sure they were also available on the Xbox 360, but for some reason i really wanted the "better" version on Xbox one. Well long story short i never played the 2 first Forza Horizon games and played the 3rd one instead on my PC years after that.</p>

			<p>The Xbox one or Xbox one series X never really appealed to me. I already have a gaming PC, which can play the same games those consoles could. I did at one point consider getting an Xbox One Series S, to use it as a streaming stations for Netflix and the likes and also play games through the Xbox Gamepass which costs 10 €/month. I never really did that either, because i already have a huge library of bought games so i don't see the need to spend 10 € every month on a game library which already has a bunch of games i have. And besides i am reaaally slow at beating singleplayer story games. I guess by playing too many Multiplayer shooters i got my brain wired to the constant action and dopamine of nonstop high octane fights.</p>
			<p>Xboxes have always been really weird consoles in my eyes. The original xbox's and xbox 360's appeal i can understand, yet using the Xbox 360 always felt weird. The interface was weird and the controller was also weird in a way if you compare it to newer controllers. In the end i would just rather play on my PC than on my Xbox 360, because i didn't feel like i really missed out on much. I wasn't allowed to play PEGI 16 or 18 rated games as a kid so Multiplayer shooters like Halo weren't really a thing for me. I got to play the golden Halo games later on PC though with the release of Halo: Master Chief Collection, which just made me realize that i'm not really that much into Halo anyways.<p>
			<p>I have to thank the Xbox 360 for giving me some really great gaming experiences as a kid. When i downloaded Steam on my pc in 2013, i started to move towards PC gaming more. Before that i pretty much only played Minecraft on my crappy laptop that i had. Speaking of Minecraft i had a lot of fun playing the Xbox edition of Minecraft with my brothers in splitscreen.</p>
